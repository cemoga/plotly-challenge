# Project Javascript

## Project Description
The goal of the project was to create an app and deploy it to `Heroku` (Cloud Application Platform).
The app runs a `Flask` server that renders the `index.html` file. The `Javascript` code queries an `sqlite` database, create a chart and plot the data using `D3` and `Plottly` libraries.
- The app deployed in Heroku can be found in the link below:
